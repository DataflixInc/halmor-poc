And this story dates back about 30 years. This story has a little bit of something for everybody. It has a little bit of biochemistry, a little bit of clinical research, a little bit of public health, a little bit of politics, a little bit of racial innuendo. The only thing it's missing is sex. (audience laughs) But, well, we can see what we can do about that, too. By the end of the story I hope I will have debunked the last 30 years of nutrition information in America. And I would very much appreciate it if at the end of the talk, you would tell me whether or not I was successful or not. Okay?

That's right, you have the answer right there. So the Atkins diet, of course, is all fat no carb. The Japanese diet's all carb, not fat. They both work, right? So what do they share in common? They both eliminate the sugar, fructose. So, with that, think about what it means to be on a diet, and what macro-nutrients you're eating and which ones your not. And then we'll go from there, and I'll try to explain how this all works. So, you've all heard about the obesity epidemic. Here are the numbers. These are the NHANES database Body Mass Index.

The reason I show this is not just to show that the obese are getting obeser, of course, that's true, but in fact the entire curve has shifted. We all weigh 25 pounds more today than we did 25 years ago, all of us. Now, it is often said that obesity is the ultimate interaction between genetics and environment. And Doctor Christian Vaisse, who's sitting in the back of the room, will be talking to you next week about the genetic component, which I am also very interested in. But, having said that, our genetic pool did not change in the last 30 years, but, boy oh boy, has our environment sure changed. So, tonight, we're gonna talk about the environment rather than genes.

And, of course, you're all familiar with the basic concept with the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the total energy inside a closed system remains constant. Now, in human terms, the standard interpretation of this law is the following. If you eat it, you better burn it, or you're gonna store it. Now, who here believes that? Oh, come on, you all do. (audience laughs) I used to believe that. I don't anymore. I think that's a mistake. I think that is the biggest mistake. And that is the phenomenon I'm going to try to debunk over the course over the next hour. Because I think there's another way to state the law which is much more relevant, and much more to the point. Before I get there, of course, if you believe that, these are the two problems, calories in, calories out. Two behaviors, gluttony and sloth.

Why are they doing bariatric surgery on children at Tokyo Children's Hospital today? Why are the Chinese, why are the Koreans, why are the Australians? I mean, all these countries who've adopted our diet all suffer now from the same problem. And we're gonna get even further in a minute. There's another way to state this first law. And that is, if you're gonna store it, that is biochemical forces that drive energy storage, and we'll talk about what they are in a few minutes, and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for normal quality of life. Because energy expenditure and quality of life are the same thing. Things that make your energy expenditure go up, make you feel good.

So, if you're gonna store it, that is an obligate weight gain set up by a biochemical process, and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for normal quality of life, then you're gonna have to eat it. And now, all of the sudden, these two behaviors, the gluttony and the sloth, are actually secondary to a biochemical process, which is primary. And it's a different way to think about the process. And it also alleviates the obese person from being the perpetrator, but rather the victim. Which is how obese people really feel. 'Cause no one chooses to be obese.

He retired at age 37 to a lifetime of gastronomic debauchery. Maybe he chose to be obese. But the kids I take care of in obesity clinic do not choose to be obese. In fact, this is the exception that proves the rule. We have an epidemic of obese six month olds. Now, if you wanna say that it's all about diet and exercise, then you have to explain this to me. So, any hypothesis that you wanna proffer that explains the obesity epidemic, you've got to explain this one too.

American adult males are eating 187 calories more per day. American adult females are eating 335 calories more per day. No question, we're all eating more. Question is why, how come? 'Cause it's all there? You know what, it was there before. We're all eating more, there's a system in our body, which you've heard about over the last couple of weeks called leptin. Everybody heard of leptin? It's this hormone that comes from your fat cell, tells your brain, \"You know what, I've had enough. \"I don't need to eat anymore. \"I'm done, and I can burn energy properly.\" Well, you know what?

So, there's something wrong with our biochemical negative feedback system that normally controls energy balance. And we have to figure out what caused it, and how to reverse it. And that's what tonight is about. But, nonetheless, there are 275 calories we have to account for. So where are they? Are they in the fat? No, they're not in the fat. Five grams, 45 calories out of the 275, nothing. In fact, it's all in the carbohydrates. 57 grams 228 calories. We're all eating more carbohydrate. Now, you all know, back int 1982, The American Heart Association, The American Medical Association, and the US Department of Agriculture admonished us to reduce our total fat consumption from 40% to 30%.

It ain't the fat, people, it ain't the fat. So what is it? Well, it's the carbohydrate. Specifically, which carbohydrate? Well, beverage intake, right? 41% increase in soft drinks, 35% increase in fruit drinks, fruitades, whatever you wanna call them. Just remember, down here, one can of soda a day, is 150 calories.

So, I call this slide, very specifically, the Coca Cola Conspiracy. Anybody here work for Coke, Pepsi? Okay, good. All right, so, this over here, 1915, the first standardized bottle of Coca Cola out of Atlanta. Anybody remember this bottle? Sure, a lot of you do.

Now, in 1955, after World War II, when sugar became plentiful again, and wasn't being rationed, we have the appearance of the 10 ounce bottle, the first one that was found in vending machines. You probably remember that one, as well. Then in 1960, the ever ubiquitous, 12 ounce can, worth 16 pounds of fat per year.

So, the corn refiners like to point out, \"Well, you know, it's just been a substitution. \"As the high fructose corn syrup's gone up, :the sugar's gone down. \"You know, we're just replacing, like gram","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":384,"to":384}}}}],["191",{"pageContent":"know, it's just been a substitution. \"As the high fructose corn syrup's gone up, :the sugar's gone down. \"You know, we're just replacing, like gram for gram.\" Well, not exactly, because here's 73 pounds of sugar per year.

Now, why did they tell us that? To stop what? To stop hear disease. Did we? No, we didn't, did we? In fact, it's worked the exact opposite. We've only created more. So, now how did this come to be? Why did they tell us to stop eating fat? Well, in the early 1970s we discovered something in our blood called LDL, low-density lipoproteins. You've heard of that, right?

So, the thought process by some very smart nutritionists, et cetera, the USDA et cetera, said, \"Well if A leads to B, and B leads to C \"then A must lead to C, therefore, no A, no C.\" This was the logic.

So, this, over here, is a book, 1972 it came out, and it was called Pure White and Deadly. It's all about sugar.

It's astounding, I am in awe of this guy. But on the other side we had this guy over here. His name was Ancel Keys. Anybody heard of him? So, Ancel Keys was a Minnesota epidemiologist, very interested in the cause of cardiovascular disease. And he performed the first multivariate regression analysis without computers. Now, anybody know what that means? Multivariate regression analysis? So, this is where you take a whole lot of data, and normally you would just run a few computer programs, but basically, the object is to try to figure out what causes what, and to try to factor out other things and determine what the contribution of various things all at once are to an outcome that you're looking for.

But, here we got England, Wales, Canada, Australia, US, you know, we are sugarholics, aren't we? We're also fataholics. So, in fact, the fat migrated with the sugar. So, here's, this is from Keys's own work. Page 262, if you wanna pick up the 500 page volume. And I'm just gonna read you the one paragraph that talks about this. The fact that the incidence rate of coronary heart disease was significantly correlated with the average percentage of calories from sucrose in the diet, is explained by the intercorrelation of sucrose with saturated fat.

Well, here's why. Because there really isn't one LDL, there are two. There are two LDLs. Here's one over here, it's called pattern A or large buoyant LDL. So, everybody knows that LDL correlates with cardiovascular disease, and that's true. I'm not gonna argue that, that is true. But, it's not this one, pattern A LDL. These guys are so light, they are buoyant, they float. So, they get carried through the bloodstream, and they don't even have a chance, because they're so big and they're so buoyant, they don't even get underneath the edge of the endothelial cells in the vasculature to start the plaque formation process.

And it's been shown by numerous investigators now, the dense LDL is the bad guy. Okay, now, when we measure LDL in the bloodstream, when you do a lipid profile, you measure both of them together, because it's too hard to distinguish the two. So, when you get an LDL, you're getting both LDLs. The neutral one and the bad one. Now, how can you tell whether your LDL is the neutral one or the bad one. What you do is you look at your triglycerides level in association with it, 'cause your triglycerides tell you which one it is.

Triglyceride to HDL ratio actually predicts cardiovascular disease way better than LDL ever did. Point is, when you measure LDL, you measure both. So, dietary fat raises your large buoyant. What do you think raises your small dense? Carbohydrate. Okay, so here's percent carbohydrate, and here's your pattern B going up. Everybody got it? So what did we do? What did we do in 1982?

Two grams of fat down, 13 grams of carbohydrate up, four of them being sugar, so that it was palatable. Well, we've just shown you that that's the worst thing you could do.

The thing that happens on your grill, happens in your arteries for the same reason. You can actually see the color too, the color change too. Fructose does not suppress the hunger hormone. There's a hormone that comes form your stomach called ghrelin you've heard about, already. So, if you preload a kid with a can of soda, and then you let him loose at the fast food restaurant, do they eat more, or do they eat less? They eat more.

Well, if the insulin doesn't go up, then leptin doesn't go up, and if leptin doesn't go up, you're brain doesn't see that you ate something. Therefor, you eat more. And finally, I'm gonna show you liver hepatic fructose metabolism is completely different between fructose and glucose, completely different. And I'm going to show you, before the evening is out, that chronic fructose exposure alone, nothing else, causes this thing we call the metabolic syndrome.

What happens to that 120 calories? You eat the 120 calories, 96 or 80% of the total will be used by all the organs in the body. 80% off the table. Why? Because every cell in the body can use glucose. Every bacteria can use glucose, every living thing on the face of the earth can use glucose, because glucose is the energy of life. That's what we were supposed to eat. 24 of those calories, or 20% will hit the liver. So let's watch what happens to those 24 calories. Here they go.

And it's gonna stimulate the second messenger here called AKT. Now what AKT does is, it stimulates this guy down here. SRABP1, sterol receptor binding protein number 1. Don't worry about it. But this is the thing that, ultimately, gets fat mechanics going. So, you 'll see in a minute.

So now, the glucose is fixed in the cell, but it's only 24 calories worth, so it's not a big bolus of it. Now, the glucose 6-phosphate almost all of it, is gonna end up going over here to something called glycagen. Now, glycagen is the storage form of glucose in the liver. Because glycagen's easy to fish the glucose out with glucagon and epinephrine. So, my question to you, and granted, this is a physiology question, is how much glycogen can your liver store before it gets sick? The answer's any amount. It's unlimited.

And the citrate then leaves the mitochondria through a process known as the citrate shuttle. And then that citrate can then be broken down by these three enzymes, which are all subservient into this SRABP1. This is ATP citrate lyase acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthase.

They can cause cancer, they cross link proteins is what they do. So, if you cross link enough proteins in your liver, what do you think happens to it?

So, this is one of the reasons why alcohol's bad. Now the acetaldehyde will come down here to something called acetate. The acetate will enter the mitochondria, just like the pyruvate did before. Will get converted to acetyl-CoA and participate in the TCA cycle, just like before, to generate energy. So that alcoholics don't die form lack of energy, they got energy, it's everything else they don't have. They're gonna have a whole lot of citrate.

And so you're gonna get a lot of the LDL. And this is the dyslipodemia of alcoholism, right here. Everybody see that? So, the liver's gonna try to export this VLDL out so that it doesn't get sick, because when fat builds up in the liver, that's not good for it. Some of it's gonna exit as free fatty acids, and those free fatty acids, will take up residence in the muscle, and you get something called muscle insulin resistance.

It's called c-jun n-terminal kinase 1, or JNK1, and it really is JNK1 because it is the bridge between metabolism and inflammation. So, when you generate JNK1, you do bad things to your liver, which I will show you when we talk about fructose. So let's talk about fructose. Fructose is sweet, we like it a lot. We like it in everything, we like it in our bread, we like it in our pretzels, we like it everywhere we look. So, let's consume 120 calories in sucrose. A glass of orange juice. Everybody got it?

The same 20/80 split we had before with glucose. So far, so good. But all 60 calories of fructose are gonna be metabolized by the liver. Why? Because only the liver can metabolize fructose. So, what do we call it, where when you take in a compound that's foreign to your body, and only the liver can metabolize it, and in the process, generates various problems? What do we call that? We call that a... Poison. So, let me show you how it's a poison. So, let's watch the fructose. So, the fructose comes in through this transporter, now.

In the process, ATP has to give up one phosphate to ADP 'cause the phosphate had to come from somewhere, so it comes from here. Now, before we had 24 calories that had to be phosphorylated. Now we have 72 calories that have to be phosphorylated. So, we have three times the substrate, and there's the rub. It's a volume issue, for right now. So, we're gonna lose a lot of phosphate, aren't we? So there's a scavenger enzyme in your liver called AMP deaminase 1 to rescue the phosphates off the rest of the ATP molecule, and it takes ADP down to AMP, adenosine monophosphate, down to IMP, Inositol monophosphatase, and finally, to the waste product uric acid.

So, now who drinks it? Fat kids, right? Not even skinny kids, fat kids drink it. Okay, so there's a problem here. Okay, and we're gonna show you how that works. Okay, so xylulose-5-phosphate, just to show you, if you take a rat, and you glycogen deplete him by making him run on an exercise wheel, and then you re-feed them with starch or with sucrose, the xylulose-5-phosphate goes way up with the sucrose. So you get more xylulose-5-phosphate through this pathway here, going over here. So why do we care about xylulose-5-phosphate? Well, here's why.

So, here's normal medical students, if you can call them normal, taking in a glucose load. Notice, almost none of it ends up as fat. Taking in a fructose load, same number of calories, 30% of it ends up as fat. So when you consume fructose, you're not consuming a carbohydrate, you're consuming fat.

So, the corollary to that is, in America at least, and around the world too, a low fat diet isn't really a low fat diet. Because the fructose or sucrose doubles as fat, it's really a high fat diet. That's why our diets don't work. And fructose, just like ethanol, for the same reason, through the same mechanism, and in the same dosing, is also as toxin. Now, last, what can we do about it? Can we do anything about it? How 'bout the FDA? You think they can do something about it. After all, aren't they supposed to regulate our food?

This is actually from the UCSF Legacy Tobacco Documents Library that Stan Glantz runs right across the street. Stan's a good guy, like Stan a lot. And he showed me this. \"Under the regulations governing food additives,\" so this came from an Altria or Phillip Morris executive, \"it is required that additives be safe, \"defined as a reasonable certainty \"by competent scientists that no harm \"will result form the intended use of the additive.\" Now, does fructose meet that standard?

Ethanol's natural, but it's not. A whole bunch of, you know, Jamaican ackee fruit's natural, but it's not either. It kills you. Keeping on going. \"A food shall be deemed to be adulterated \"if it bears or contains any poisonous \"or deleterious substance which may \"render it injurious to health.\" Fructose fits that description, right? Uh-uh, but now with the prevention of chronic diseases, even though it's own regulations explicitly postulate the connection between such products and such diseases.

That would mean an admission to the world that our food is a problem. So, what to you think that would do? There are three things in this country that we can still sell overseas.

A calorie is not a calorie. And the dietitians in the country are actually perpetrating this on us. Because the more you think a calorie's a calorie, the more you think, well than if you ate less and exercise more, it would work. It doesn't. All of the studies show it doesn't work. Here's why it doesn't work, because a calorie is not a calorie. Fructose is not glucose. We know a calorie is not a calorie. 'Cause there are good fats and bad fats.

picture is to say that when you have my bomian gland dysfunction you can picture you then also have a dry eye issue because the tear is evaporating and you're getting dry spots it gets to be scratchy and gritty so now as a big positive to this story is I actually did have a patient about I guess four years ago and he had come in I'd say repetitively over a three to four month period and had these

slowing the progression of disease and if I can get the physician Community to understand that then they have to do their homework they have to go down the rabbit hole and understand these diets and now there's you know a gazillion books we've all written them um that'll help them understand it and then when their next patient is diagnosed they could say we have these two options it conventional

kind of love-hate relationship with free radicals turns out your body makes these little devils to help fight off various viruses and microbes the problem is that if you make too many or if you're

every day when it comes to the specific health benefits of polyphenols for the sake of this tell-all let's break them down into the following categories anti-aging benefits sharp mental clarity and focus healthy heart support let's start with anti-aging the process of aging is simple as you get older your body's forced to deal with more and more damaging changes to the cells and tissues that

the thing is your body is always fighting oxidative damage but as you age the rate of damage can grow because your body's ability to heal itself slows down so a polyphenol-rich diet can be helpful in mitigating the harmful effects of aging which is why i suggest focusing on eating the big three dark leafy vegetables the right nuts such as walnuts and pistachios and polyphenol-rich in-season fruits in moderation of course dark berries and pomegranates are great place to start and that extends to keeping you sharp and focused too see oxidative stress impacts all kinds of cells and tissues

cognition and not something you want to be without and that's true when it comes to a healthy heart too research also shows a possible correlation between polyphenols and fewer incidences of heart health issues for example a polyphenol-rich diet might be linked to a lower risk of blood flow decrease polyphenols can also encourage blood vessels to produce more nitric oxide nitric oxide can relax

sugary either that makes it a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth and support your health coffee and tea are also great sources of polyphenols just make sure not to add tons of cream and sugar which

phytochemical known to man so let's talk about first of all i'm curious if you agree with me oh sure talk about phycocyanin what some of the research has shown as far as the benefits of that and the

the benefits of that and the benefits of spirulina more broadly it's pretty crazy uh and it's um and here's the thing um even with 60 000 studies on spirulina there's still so much yet to learn and you know one of the reasons i want to be successful is that you know that we could hopefully fund some of that research because um there's other pigments in there of course there's beta-carotene it has the highest beta-carotene but we're still learning what these things do so let's let's look at that gorgeous blue phycocyanin first of all it's a water-based pigment and i mentioned that because when we get to talk about chlorella i'll point out the benefits of the fact that chlorophyll is a fat based pigment so they do completely different things in your body but one of the amazing features of phycocyanin is it has what's called anti-angiogenesis properties that's a mouthful i know but what that means is that it intercepts um well let me back up when tumors

let me back up when tumors and and cancers well they basically hijack your blood vessels to and re-root them to feed the cancer cells uh to keep them growing and phycocyanin for whatever reason has a and that's called angiogenesis when that happens uh phycocyanin has the ability to prevent that to intercept that and i didn't even know that until about five years ago and there there's a an association a very large association right here in cambridge massachusetts called the angiogenesis society it's angiogen.org and they were having their global conference and they called us and they said you know did you know that your spirulina can prevent cancer by this angiogenesis anti-angiogenesis process and i said no it and they invited us to come to their conference for free um because

know i i point out that i'm not as i'm not a medical professional and anything i say is not to be construed as medical advice um i only reference the science that i have read so that being said the science shows and we have examples of the sources for this on our website that um the again phycocyanin has this remarkable ability to intercept the covet virus so it cannot enter your blood vessels

the way it enters your body is through something called an ace2 receptor cell and most of those are in your nose your throat your lungs um and so this phycocyanin sits on top of the ace2 receptor cell it's sort of like a shield it's like a super super hero and it prevents that prong from the covet virus from attaching so it can't get into your cell and it just slides through so um and so what's happened is that the university of pittsburgh pharmacology department has actually developed a nose spray based on this that is being used as a vaccine for for covid so pretty impressive stuff and of

and that's the beautiful thing about truth it just makes sense well there's also research showing uh you know well let me let me jump back one step for for listeners which is that uh one of the big problems one of the things that really kills you with covid is not just the virus itself it's your immune system over reacting over responding to the cytokine and to the damage that the virus creates

alpha tumor necrosis factor alpha and it's a major pro-inflammatory cytokine and there's research showing spirulina leads to profound uh levels of reduction 70 plus levels of reduction in tnf alpha that's really cool i didn't know that well the other cool thing since we're talking about cova and that wasn't going to because we're so sick of it right um it's not just a lung disorder and as you

the iron atom is no longer in your hemoglobin instead the virus is there so as your blood is circulating it can no longer carry oxygen uh to your cells and to your major organs and one of the first ones that that uh gives out is your is your heart and but it's worse than that so when the iron is kicked out of the hemoglobin it doesn't disappear it's still in your blood but it is no longer protected in the hemoglobin i i compare hemoglobin to bubble wrap it you know when it when the iron is in there it's it's you know like bubble wrap it's it's carefully protected because if you've ever

inflammatory inflammation this rogue um uh iron atom is causing even more damage because it's no longer protected in the um in the hemoglobin so it's uh it's pretty crazy and one of the reasons i like you know algae so much and i don't have science about this i will you know just tell you that um but because algae is so uh um is so alkaline it has so much iron in it i'm thinking that you'd think it would help restore the iron atom in the blood and also the other thing is when whether it's viruses covavirus any virus cancer any disease is acidic and um our our

another well your hemoglobin is the same way it's sort of like a negative charge around it and the reason for that is so that they don't clump in your blood in your blood when they're traveling and this allows them to a be nice and round so they can carry the ox the iron atom and carry oxygen and so they don't clump when the virus gets into your blood because it kicks out the iron atom and because it's acidic it not only steals your uh prevents your blood from carrying oxygen it causes them to clump because now it's acidic and they have found as they do any kind of you know with the

highest concentration of chlorophyll in the world chlorella has twice as much as um spirulina because spirulina has that second um blue pigment that we just talked about and the reason the only

soils are so over cropped there's no nitrogen or nutrients in the soil for the plants to have in them and this co2 is so damaged that they're finding plants have more sugar in them now and i have all

what is normal on a carnivore-based diet or a meat-based diet that eats primarily meats without any fibers or minimal fibers so how often should we go what does it all mean i know that there are people in the community that say hey if you don't go even three four five days that's okay because it's just showing that your body is absorbing all the nutrients i can see the logic in that and that

very high fiber diet but you don't want to be having stools every three threes kind of like on the borderline of it's okay um but you know every five days or seven days that is in my book would be

sufficiently i talk about this in carniver cure but there are ideals for drinking water now i know that not everyone in the carnivore community agrees with me but in general you want to drink about half of your body weight in ounces so if i weigh 200 pounds then my average consumption of water should be about 100 ounces if i drink diuretics so coffees teas any of those if i drink eight ounces of coffee for example then i should want to drink at least another eight ounces to one and a half times so 12 ounces of more water to kind of dilute some of those diuretics so then my total water

these in a day and then that will get your water consumption out there are so many reasons why it's so important to hydrate the body it is a way that we detox in the body so i can do a separate video later about the importance of hydration but just know that in general you should at least get close to half of your body weight in ounces you don't want to guzzle it at once because that will be a tax on your kidneys that has to filtrate through all of the water you're drinking so you want to kind of drink slow and steady throughout the day you don't want to drink a lot

don't want to drink a lot of water by your meals but make sure you are hydrating um i recommend my clients use a little bit of the sole water so that you are also balancing minerals and you are not just depleting yourself of electrolytes the second one is to drink water away from your meal so this is where my clients get upset at me because they're like okay so you want me to drink like 100 ounces of water or half of my body weight in ounces of water but then you don't want me to really drink close to my meal and then a little after and then not a lot in between so then when can i drink my water so this is where it does get a little tricky you know i see in general if you can drink like three to four ounces with your meal you sip it but generally you don't really want to drink a lot

acidic so that we can break down our foods and then remove any of the toxins bacteria any of the pathogens so that then it can get into the small intestine to have nutrients be digested and absorbed and so this is where if you drink a lot of water with your meals or even coffee as you can see it will dilute the ph levels and you will just be impairing your digestive process this is where as a side note that you don't want to be drinking alkaline waters in general i know that there's a lot of push in the communities now where they say our bodies are

drinking it when we are eating our food which our stomach acid needs to be at one and a half so it can dilute it and there are some studies that show that when you drink alkaline water it will keep your ph levels at 0.5 to 1.0 higher than it should be for the next 30 minutes so if you want to drink the alkaline waters because you feel like your body is too acidic and you believe in all of those things then drink it away from your meals i don't care if you do i think it's a great marketing gimmick i don't think we need these alkaline waters we have different ph levels all throughout the body

do is again limit your waters around your meals all right number three so if you aren't drinking a lot of water by your meal some people say well i can't get my food down well then the thing is then obviously we should be chewing more of our bites so the general kind of ideal rule of thumb is that you are chewing at least 15 to 30 bites for every bite you have now some people find it very ridiculous but it's ideal for our digestive process so when we are chewing or we're masticating we are basically releasing solutes in our mouth and that's why we

they are stressed during the day they have a busy life busy work schedule and they're just kind of eating because they just need to feel their body i asked them to just do a few deep breathing exercises to force the body to get into a rest and relax state and so then they can be better prepared to digest because the digestive process works in a rest and relaxed state when you eat when

homogenized and i've done several social media posts on this but if you eat a lot of dairy and especially when it's processed it can wreak havoc on our digestive process it is not the same as eating raw dairy which has the enzymes that help to break down some of the lactose and all the other antibodies that are support the gut when it's eating raw milk or raw dairy so what you want is if you notice that you eat i don't know like uh four to six ounces of dairy a day in terms of cheese and you feel constipated you may want to back off the cheese for a little bit now block cheeses are

some like string cheese all of these processed foods not only do they have fillers and additives but just the processing itself because it's not a natural real food it can cause constipation there

And what this paper really shows is that there's a set of peptides in the body, and the peptide that I'm referring to today is called GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide one, and some related peptides.

Yerba mate is a tea that can promote the release of glucagon-like peptide one, and there are also new prescription drugs that are now hitting the market and for which there are really impressive clinical trials for diabetes and obesity that are essentially glucagon-like peptide one stimulators, so they stimulate the release of that, or they are in fact a synthetic version of glucagon-like peptide one. What is glucagon-like peptide one? It is a peptide, which is a small little protein, that can dramatically suppress appetite.

Nonetheless, should also point out that yerba mate comes in a bunch of different forms. There is some concern about certain smokey flavored forms of yerba mate being carcinogenic, so that's why I avoid those forms of yerba mate, but for me, yerba mate is one of the preferred sources of caffeine for me, I like the way it tastes.

Glucagon-like peptide one, as I mentioned earlier, can suppress appetite, but what this paper shows is it does that by at least two mechanisms through parallel pathways. What this paper shows is that glucagon-like peptide one acts on receptors in the body in a portion of the nervous system called the enteric nervous system, e-n-t-e-r-i-c, enteric nervous system. This is a component of your nervous system that you don't really have control over. It's autonomic or automatic. GLP-1 binds to what are called intestinofugal enteric neurons.

So it can lead to actually mild, or I suppose if levels of GLP-1 are very high, to major gut distension. Okay, I think that the levels of GLP-1 that would come from drinking yerba mate and hopefully from appropriate dosaging of the synthetic forms of GLP-1 or drugs that stimulate GLP-1 would cause mild, not major gut distension, 'cause major gut distension would be uncomfortable. So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut to increase gut distension and by way of a pathway that goes from the gut up to the hypothalamus, this little cluster of neurons about the size of a marble that sits above the roof of your mouth is also suppressing appetite through brain mechanisms.

So to me, GLP-1 is both impressive and important. Why? Because this recent category of drugs that's now hitting the market seems to adjust obesity or can help people with weight loss in order to help their health, and it's doing so by at least two mechanisms. One is within the brain and the other is within the gut and communication through the so-called gut brain access.

But at the same time, things like yerba mate and I'm sure there are other compounds out there as well, but certainly yerba mate can stimulate the release of GLP-1, so for those of you that are looking for some mild appetite suppression and want to accomplish that while also ingesting caffeine, yerba mate might be a good option for that, and just know that it's operating through two mechanisms on the body through mild gut distension to make you feel full and on the brain to increase satiety or make you feel less hungry.

it means is that there's food available but you choose not to eat it and the reasons are up to you starvation on the other hand is when you don't know when food is going to be available that's not

Well, it's a great question. And I think I'm the only person that's helping people truly understand what they are. So first of all, algae is a food. It's its own food category 'cause it's technically not a plant. It's not a fruit. It's not an animal. And within the category called algae, there's two main types, macroalgae and microalgae. We're gonna talk mostly about microalgae. But first, let me confirm what macroalgae is. It is that stringy stuff that you mentioned that washes up on shore, also known as seaweed.

Very fibrous. No nutrition. Microalgae is the complete opposite. It has virtually no fiber. In fact, spirulina has zero fiber 'cause it's technically a bacteria, but it is the most nutrient dense food in the world. And even we have a quote from NASA that even confirms that. And the reason why there's so much nutrition in it is because they're so microscopic. You can get like a million cells on the head of a pin. So when you can consolidate them into these tablets, you start to understand why there's so much nutrition in there. Now, unlike seaweed, the macroalgae, which is only in the sea, microalgae is everywhere. It's in the lakes, the rivers, the streams, the soil, your swimming pool, your aquarium.

Now what I want you to know is that one strain of blue-green algae is called spirulina. There's other strains. So if you read about a blue-green algae closing your beach, they're not talking about spirulina. And by the way, poor algae gets a bum rap because algae only shows up on your beach because it kills bacteria. So somehow, toxins have gotten into the water and you can't see them, but they're there. And algae is the cleanup crew and it's very visible and it absorbs all the toxins and it kills the bacteria. By the way, it's also the cleanup crew in your body. So it's not just the beach.

But the main thing that people know spirulina for is its energy, which is why we call Lars \"Energy This.\" How does it give you energy? Well, first of all, spirulina, as I mentioned earlier, is a bacteria. It does not have a cellulous wall. Why is that important? Because that means there's nothing for your body to have to break down to get access to the rich nutrition that's in there. So that's number one. Very rapid absorption. Bioavailability is key.

But algae, the aminos are individual. Again, why is that important? Because it allows your body to access all those rich aminos instantly.

The best way to describe how you'll feel is you just feel awake. That's it. Like you had a great night's sleep or a walk in the fresh air. And that to me, that's, I mean I live on this stuff and I mean I do eat real food, but I couldn't imagine life without algae, especially spirulina because it's so nourishing.

And we're going to, you know, circle back a little bit because we talked about the mitochondria at the very beginning.

And I got a lot of pushback that plant protein is not absorbable. It's not digestible and that you have to eat meat because that's the only way you can get protein. And help our listeners understand that at least with algae, with spirulina, that may not be the case. - Absolutely. And I think everyone has a point of view and it reminds me of that graphic. I'm sure everyone's seen it of, it was an elephant in the room and there's a number of people with blindfolds and each one of them have their hand on a different part of the elephant and they think it's an animal of some kind based on what their hand is","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":396,"to":396}}}}],["444",{"pageContent":"and each one of them have their hand on a different part of the elephant and they think it's an animal of some kind based on what their hand is touching.

So there are, you know, people who are vegan, they're mixing different beans and rice to get a complete protein. But when it comes to algae, it is a complete protein. It has, as I said, the 18 of the 20 aminos. In fact, it has more collagen and more aminos than even collagen powder. So anyone who's taking collagen powder, you don't have to take that anymore if you take at least 10 to 30 of the spirulina tablets a day. It also replaces, you know, a multivitamin, a fish oil, CoQ10. And we can dig into that later on.

It's not a real B12.\" Well, we did some research and it is the real B12. So I wanna assure people of that and we can send anybody who wants the science about that. So this is from Mother Nature. She, I tell people, you know, when you take individual supplements, it's sort of like listening to a single soloist.

(laughs) - I know when we started, you started to, you mentioned that algae is a great source of superoxide dismutase, the SOD. Are there other things that algae contain that help our mitochondria that are kind of unique to algae rather than other food sources? - Right. Well, glutathione is another one of those nutrients that can get into the mitochondria to stop the free radical damage.

So you get, a lot of people do it after they've been out late at night and they want to clear out their liver. Glutathione by the way is also a great detoxer. But spirulina and chlorella, particular chlorella, and I need to circle back to explain what chlorella is 'cause we did talk about spirulina. So glutathione is very detoxing, which helps your cells to function properly and it also can get into that inner membrane to stop free radical damage.

And again, this is why I feel that this is to me the reason why people are getting new disease. It's a combination of not getting proper nutrition from other foods, having too many toxins in their body, which will address when we talk about chlorella, but also not having the mitochondrial protection from antioxidants that they used to have made for them, you know, for free. And there are no other sources that are as concentrated of glutathione or superoxide dismutase as algae. The other nutrients you wanted me to, I think I'd like to mention are chlorophyll.

Anyways, it recycles the CoQ10 molecule and generates ATP for you without food. Pretty amazing, right? And chlorophyll is a fat-based pigment. So again, we talked earlier about the cells having a membrane that's made of fats and that's why you need vitamin E and vitamin A and vitamin D, Omega-3 to keep your cell membranes healthy because healthy membranes allow nutrients in and toxins out.

So what I'm about to tell you, and this'll blow you away, but it's all science-based, can only be found in either our algae or any algae that's raw. So what does phycocyanin do?

And it went from a dense Petri dish of cancer cells to virtually none in just 24 hours. Cancer cells gone. And what stuns me is the amount of phycocyanin that they used in this test.

You need to take a subway or shuttle train to get to your gate 'cause, you know, even though you're at the airport, if you can't get on the right shuttle train to get to your gate, you aren't getting on any plane.

But in a cancer cell or something, they call 'em zombie cells, also known as a senescent cell. These are cells that have duplicated so many times, there's nothing left in them, but they don't die and they don't leave.

There's another way that the blue phycocyanin works powerfully in the cancer world is that it has what's called anti-angiogenesis properties. What does that mouthful mean? Well, it means angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels. And so anti-angiogenesis means the interruption of that. And what happens with cancers and tumors is they basically hijack your blood vessels and reroute them to feed the cancer or the tumor. And the blue phycocyanin found in spirulina, if it's raw like ours or frozen, stops that process. It stops the rerouting of the blood vessels to the tumors. And we didn't even know that.

But nobody's sharing this with the rest of the world. And who wants to go through, A, who wants to get cancer? And by the way, cancer cells are in our bodies, as you know, all the times.

I'd say that was pretty important stuff. And you don't ever have to advance into these late stages cancer or get, you know, chemotherapy. And at the same time, algae is also the most alkaline food in the world. And that started me on this entire journey.

The easiest one for, I'm sure people know about, is that it has fiber. So it feeds your gut biome. It feeds your healthy bacteria what they need to create the short chain fatty acids that are important for your health. By the way, 80% of your immune system is in your gut. So at the same time that you're building your gut biome, you are supporting your immune system. Number two, that hard cell wall attaches to toxins.

So people take it after a workout. So it chelates them and pulls them all out of your body. So, A, the fiber feeds gut biome. B, the hard cell wall attaches the toxins. Now chlorella's big claim to fame is it has the highest amount of chlorophyll in the world. Remember, spirulina has the highest protein in the world and also lots of essential fatty acids. Chlorella has fewer fatty acids, but rich in chlorophyll. 500 times more chlorophyll than arugula and 25 times more than liquid chlorophyll.

So we did a small clinical trial of our own back in February. We worked with a nonprofit group called The Gray Team. They're based in Florida. And their goal, their purpose for existence is to stop the suicide rate of military veterans, which is at a heartbreaking 35% to 50%. Just let that sink in. 35% to 50% of military veterans are committing suicide. That's unacceptable to me. So we had met these, their, the group a number of times, and they're trying all sorts of interventions. So they said, well, let's do a nutritional one. So we had a small group and we did a brain scan before they started and we also connected them to something called Wadi, which measured their heart rate and heart rate variability","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":396,"to":396}}}}],["471",{"pageContent":"did a brain scan before they started and we also connected them to something called Wadi, which measured their heart rate and heart rate variability and sleep patterns.

Just take 30 of these tablets a day. Now, when we did this, the second brain scan, and we probably could have, should have, next time we'll do it again with a bigger group, do a brain scan every week. But after 30 days, with the first brain scan, by the way, I wanna back up. These veterans had been discharged for up to 15 or 20 years because they'd had brain issues. So these were conditions that they had been living with. We had someone with MS for a long time. They were willing to try anything. Of course, it was just food, so.

It showed that the brain was inflamed and no activity. And so, and with inflammation, that's when you have damaged mitochondria. 99% of, or 90% of inflammation is in the mitochondria. 30 days later with, all they did was take 30 tablets. Inflammation gone. Completely gone. And the MS person with, their shakes went away. They slept better. One of the individuals whose data we have, they had something called the heart rate variability, which shows your ability to respond to stress. They had a 50% improvement within 30 days, which is almost unheard of. So we're getting the findings written up in the paper. Probably won't be ready till next year.

It's just the needs of your body. And most of those needs are dictated by your mitochondria. And your mitochondria are affected directly by what you eat.

So I tell people, I never eat alone. I always eat with my mitochondria. So when you understand that carbs create the most free radicals, processed carbs, that alone will start you on the path to having less mitochondria damage. And because your mitochondria and your cells are constantly regrowing, it's like, you know, if you don't water your lawn, it's not gonna come back green. You have to give it some care and attention. Your body and your mitochondria and your brain are the same way. Just give it a little TLC. And now you know about these nutrients.

Health Organization would characterize as being the number one cause of death on our planet that said if insulin functionality is playing such a pivotal role and these diseases are increasing aggressively why is it that more and more people are becoming less able to use their insulin effectively right yeah that's a great way of framing the question and just so that the audience appreciates

non-communicable chronic disease it means it's ALS not only is it very prevalent but also very relevant so how does it start firstly let me just provide my own very brief definition of what insulin resistance is and I I will invoke this a metaphor of of a coin that imagine this coin that I'm holding is insulin resistance on one side of the coin is the phenomenon that you just described which is

coin over because the other side of the coin that we call insulin resistance is an obligatory hyperinsulinemia or chronically elevated insulin and that a good place to start um because of the handful of causes of insulin resistance I firmly believe that chronically elevated insulin is the most relevant of the causes in other words if a person is living a lifestyle which is chronically keeping their insulin at an elevated State they become they become progressively more and more resistant to that insulin at least some of the cells of the body do and this then is the insulin resistance in

resistance but a failure of the body to respond to the insulin is in turn promoting a greater need for insulin and so we end up with this scenario in which hyperinsulinemia is both cause and consequence of insulin resistance hey guys we're going to get right back to the podcast but I wanted to let you know that today's podcast is being brought to you by our friends at Chef's Foundry this

probably been some some period of time about an hour or so before the next meal when insulin has been able to come back down to fasting conditions so they have most of their day is spent with normal

as a hedge against starvation uh help to raise the blood pressure so for these reasons well beyond gout getting the uric acid level down uh you know is what we were talking about what people continue to recommend and you know if allulose can can help us with that goal by helping us reduce fructose input that's that's a big positive let's CLE back around to insulin resistance because uh we opened

convenient answer because we've already discussed it so ampk will increase the rate at which a cell is using energy or using nutrients to to burn nutrients for the sake of producing energy for the cell to work exercise activates ampk fasting activates ampk um that if you and because one of ampk's effect is to use more glucose you want to make the cell more insulin sensitive for example a muscle cell or a fat cell is going to have a hard time using glucose if it's not insulin sensitive because it needs insulin in order to get the glucose um to be pulled in except for exercise in the case of

becomes a primary solution to improving insulin sensitivity because it will directly activate that pathway yeah that it does feed back to our discussion moments ago about uric acid we know that amp has to be metabolized and generally we consider the fact that well that's what amp kinas is all about but it turns out that ampk has an evil twin which is deaminase uh and what amp damin says is

elevation of uric acid uric acid is one of the Arbiters of determining which way we go amp KY on the good hand uh and Damas on the bad side and another area that's really relevant to this discussion I think and we'll talk about how alos plays into that is this production of uh fatty fatty liver disease non-alcoholic fatty liver disease how do you see allulose positioned uh in terms even some of the

and then scarred and it really is the Gateway problem to further much more catastrophic liver problems so we want to catch it at the fatty liver State because we can still turn it around and we can turn it around quickly now where does the fat come from there are two sources for that fat one source is insulin resistant fat cells where the fat cells that are Upstream from the viscera as they start leaking their fats in a state of high insulin um then it it the liver will readily pull that in and store it so that's one source um and in that case if alose can improve by activating ampk the insulin sensitivity of the fat cell then that fat won't be leaking out of the fat cell in a state of high insulin it's okay for a fat cell to leak fat in a state of

it will have to store it it turns it into triglycerides and now we have fatty liver disease but the other so right there alos is once again potentially relevant at the fat cell um but then second we come back to fructose because the other most common form of the liver accumulating fat or the most common mechanism is it is it making its own fat this process called lipo Genesis and fructose I'll

getting it and rather than um having the the building block for fat in contrast you're activating ampk in the liver which will promote fat oxidation or the burning of the fat so then you begin literally resolving the problem rather than contributing to it I think Rick Johnson said it very well he said glucose is the uh the sugar of energy utilization and uh and fructose is the sugar of

it is through that pathway or not alose increases the expression of a master mitochondrial regulator called pgc1 Alpha and there's lots of acronyms here that you and I are invoking here but suffice it to say um when pgc1 Alpha is turned on we now have pulled up the lever of the most significant activator of mitochondrial biogenesis so the synthesis of new mitochondria so in that sense um alos

means four grams of fat for every one gram of everything else that means about 90 of your calories are coming from fat because fat has more calories than carbohydrates and protein but there's fasting

have collaborative consortia or guilds are called where they collaborate to generate specific effects well uh I know of one product one product on the market and I have no relationship with the

This doesn't just mean cutting out bread, pasta and grains, it means truly giving your eating habits a hard reset. Perhaps one of the most daunting elements of the keto diet for people can be the idea that they have to count every single carb. We do encourage you to track your macros and be mindful of your carb intake. But there is one simple strategy that helps to clear up any confusion around how much of what foods you should and shouldn't be eating: choose mostly keto-friendly foods that have little to no net carbs. There are so many low - and no-carb options, you have hundreds of delicious options to choose from! To help simplify things and make your keto journey as easy as possible, we've put together the ultimate list of zero-carb foods for you to enjoy. Before we begin, it's important to note that nearly every kind of food has some sort of trace carbohydrate content.

When we say \"zero carbs,\" we are talking about foods and beverages that contain less than one gram of net carbs per serving, and foods that aren't usually consumed in large enough quantities to negatively affect your daily carb consumption. Now, let's take a look at zero-carb foods, starting with meats: Beef, fowl and pork are familiar meats that provide you with protein. Less common types of meats, like veal, lamb, game meats, including venison and elk, and exotic meats, can help add variety and interest to your meals. Organ meats can be a good choice, too, but just be aware that liver contains glycogen, a source of net carbs. When possible, seek out grass-fed and pasture-raised meats. While it's typically best to avoid processed meats, cured and dried meats, like bacon, salami, hot dogs, deli meats, jerky and canned meats are fan favorites on the keto diet that can used on occasion.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":406,"to":406}}}}],["809",{"pageContent":"cured and dried meats, like bacon, salami, hot dogs, deli meats, jerky and canned meats are fan favorites on the keto diet that can used on occasion.

Always try to buy all-natural processed meats that contain carb-free ingredients. Fresh and tinned seafood, many of which contain beneficial omega-3 fatty acid, are another great source of protein. White flaky fish like cod, flounder, sole and haddock, are tasty, as are fattier, more flavorful fish, like salmon, tuna, halibut, swordfish, sardines, Spanish mackerel, trout and others. We've found that the healthiest option is to buy wild caught salmon and sardines, canned or fresh without any other ingredients.

Avoid any spice blends with added sugars, of course, and instead, try salt and black pepper, dried oregano, rosemary, thyme, basil, chives and dill. Chili powder, curry powder and cinnamon may contain higher traces of carbs and should be used a bit more sparingly. Some condiments, like sugar-free hot sauces and mustard can also add tons of flavor with hardly any carbs at all. While all sugars are cut out from a keto diet, there are plenty of ways to add a hint of sweetness to the dishes we prepare. Zero-carb sweeteners include liquid stevia, monk fruit extract or blends, erythritol and liquid sucralose.

Keep in mind that for some people, drinking sweeter drinks can trigger sugar cravings in the long-term. When it comes to alcohol, those following the keto diet need to proceed carefully. Some alcoholic drinks have virtually no net carbs, but alcohol will slow fat burning while your body processes it.

check out that video that I filmed on that study that showed how putting people on zero fiber diets cured their constipation not only that cured their gas and bloating in all of them a hundred percent

so good so filling so much good protein and fat in there just try not to make eggs like your every single meal type of food that's supposed to be like maybe one a day or whatever you know that kind of

that's gonna add like nothing added to it okay none of that stuff you can have sausages you can have cured meats and like I was saying before you can definitely have bacon um so that list is pretty comprehensive you know I didn't do any of that stuff before I didn't have any of the the milk and the yogurt and the cheese I really do think that if you're gonna start this out you want to just

we all get it wrong is that we think that we can we can we can suggest that kind of thing when really body types are all so different so just my recommendation would be to remove everything except for meat and then start to add that stuff into this kind of less optimal food list as you go maybe after a month too or so okay and then the final list uh this is not one that is super popular because

metabolically different and their dietary makeup is drastically different from the general population many Physicians prefer caution until you know more definitive Definitive data exist so for them

These \n guidelines have been slow to change, partly due to institutional inertia. The process of \n updating dietary guidelines to reflect new scientific findings is complex and often \n lagging behind the latest research. \n 2. Lack of Training in Nutrition \n Many doctors and dietitians receive limited training in nutrition, and what is taught often \n aligns with traditional dietary guidelines that emphasize low-fat, high-carbohydrate \n diets.
